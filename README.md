# Data Science Portfolio
Portfolio with some of my data science projects.

This repository contains visualization of data and creation of machine learning models for the following datasets:

### Human Activity Recognition (HAR)
- [Signals Visualization](https://github.com/catarina-mtpires/data-science/blob/main/HAR/Data%20Visualization.ipynb) - analysis and visualization of accelerometer and gyroscope signals.
- [Machine Learning]() - model to predict the activity an individual is performing based on inertial signals embedded in smartphones.  
This is an open datased from UCI Machine learning repository that can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/human+activity+recognition+using+smartphones).
