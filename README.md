# Data Science Portfolio
Portfolio with some of my data science projects.

This repository contains visualization of data, analysis of data with SQL and python, and creation of machine learning models for the following datasets:

### Human Activity Recognition (HAR)
- [Signals Visualization](https://github.com/catarina-mtpires/data-science/blob/main/HAR/Data%20Visualization.ipynb) - analysis and visualization of accelerometer and gyroscope signals.
- [Machine Learning](https://github.com/catarina-mtpires/data-science/blob/main/HAR/Machine%20Learning.ipynb) - model to predict the activity an individual is performing based on inertial signals embedded in smartphones.  

This is an open source datased from UCI Machine learning repository that can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/human+activity+recognition+using+smartphones).

### IMDb 
- [SQLite Database](https://github.com/catarina-mtpires/data-science/blob/main/IMDb/Create%20SQLite3%20Database.ipynb) - creation of a SQLite Databased with data from IMDb.
- [Data Analysis](https://github.com/catarina-mtpires/data-science/blob/main/IMDb/Data%20Analysis.ipynb) - SQL analysis of IMDb database. 

The IMDb data used in this project can be found [here](https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/).

### My Fitbit Data (<i>Currently in progress</i>)

- [Data Overview](https://github.com/catarina-mtpires/data-science/blob/main/Fitbit/data_overview.md) - detailed description of data extracted from fitbit. 

Fitbit allows its users to download and access their personal data, which includes activity, sleep, heart rate, among others. This dataset contains my personal Fitbit data, collected with Fitbit Sense smartwatch from December 2021 to September 2022.
